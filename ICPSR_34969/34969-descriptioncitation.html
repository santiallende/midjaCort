		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The MIDJA Biomarker study obtained biological assessments from a subsample (n=382) of MIDJA Survey (ICPSR 30822) respondents (N=1027). Participants traveled to a clinic near the University of Tokyo campus where Biomarker data (vital signs, morphometric assessments, blood assays, and medication data) were obtained. Participants also provided daily saliva samples for cortisol assessment and completed a self-administered medical history questionnaire. The questionnaire included assessments of conditions and symptoms, major health and life events, nutrition/diet, and additional psychosocial measures (anxiety, depression, relationship quality, control etc.). These measures parallel those in a national longitudinal sample of midlife Americans known as MIDUS (ICPSR 4652: MIDUS II and ICPSR 2760: MIDUS I). The central objective is to compare the Japanese sample (MIDJA) with the United States sample (MIDUS) to test the hypotheses regarding cultural differences in aging health and well-being as well as in how psychosocial factors are linked with biological factors known to influence profiles of disease and disability.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> This deposit is a new addition to the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Series, The title of this study was changed from Survey of Midlife Development in Japan (MIDJA): Biomarker Project, 2009-2010, to Survey of Midlife in Japan (MIDJA): Biomarker Project, 2009-2010, on May 9, 2017., Additional information about the Survey of Midlife Development in Japan can be found at the <a href="http://midus.wisc.edu">MIDUS</a> web site.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> This data is a subsample of the MIDJA Survey. There were two eligibility criteria for this second phase of the data collection: (1) completed the initial survey phase and (2) expressed interest in participating in the second, biomarker, phase by returning a post card to CRS as described above.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> A subsample of the MIDJA Survey sample (ICPSR 30822) which is comprised of non-institutionalized, Japanese-speaking adults, aged 30-79 and living in one of the 23 wards of Tokyo from April 2008-September 2008.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> clinical data, survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> See the "Documentation of Scales and Constructed Variables in MIDJA Biomarker" available through the ICPSR and NACDA Web sites for complete information regarding the scales for the MIDJA Biomarker data collection.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> 2020-07-07 The DS1 Aggregate Data was updated to correct value labels in the variable J1SQ1., 2019-03-28 <p>This update includes an expanded version of DS1 Aggregate Data along with several documentation changes. Question text and online analysis tools have been added to DS1. </p>
<p>DS2 Stacked Medication Data has been updated to improve usability and add question text. No changes to the data in DS2 have occurred.</p>, 2018-03-20 A second dataset was added to the study (DS2: Stacked Medication file). And existing data files and documents were re-submitted to reflect the new change in the Study title., 2018-02-15 The citation of this study may have changed due to the new version control system that has been implemented.
